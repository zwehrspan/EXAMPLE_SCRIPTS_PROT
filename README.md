# EXAMPLE_SCRIPTS_PROT
This directory contains a simple script used to calculte the translational and rotational diffusion of coarse-grained proteins in simulations and a script used to graph some of the resulting data. The protein data in the directory is anonymized and reduced from its full form. Coarse-grained simualtions of proteins were conducted and then the models were adjusted to more accurately reproduce diffusion.

The script used to calculate rotational and translation diffusion works on a data file produced by another program writtent to extract diffusion information from simulations.

The plotting script shows some of the results of these calculation. For example, the intial abd final diffusion ratios (simulation / experiment) can be plotted for the proteins:

We can also explore the distributions of those ratios:
